The increasing prevalence of joint diseases in pets, particularly in older dogs and cats, is driving the demand for orthopedic implants. The adoption of advanced veterinary surgical procedures and the growing awareness about joint health among pet owners are key factors contributing to the market's expansion. Additionally, advancements in implant technology, including the development of biocompatible materials and custom implants, are further fueling growth in this market.</p><p>In 2022, North America accounted for the largest market share, owing to the region's high veterinary healthcare standards and a large population of pet owners.
